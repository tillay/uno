# UNO GAME
This is a simple uno game for a linux terminal.

The only requirments are a computer that can run python and bash, and a terminal that accepts ansii escape sequences.

Installation:

git clone https://github.com/tillay/uno

cd into it and install:

cd uno

./install.sh

to play:
python3 main.py

To play in the future, make sure you are in the correct directory and type the same command.

Modification:
to change number of starting cards and type of game (singleplayer or against computer) run the installer script again

to change the width of each column, modify the instance varaible with width = 10. Not reccomended unless you dont prefer base 10

(numbers also get kinda offset too)
